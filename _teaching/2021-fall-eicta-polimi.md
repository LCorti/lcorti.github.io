Enterprise systems today are the core operational and strategic tools of companies. Security is a paramount issue that spans all the levels and types of such systems. Therefore, a holistic view to security problems implies a global understanding of the enterprise information systems, architectures, and relations among them.
This course aims at giving a broad vision of all the important elements of enterprise information systems, of the technologies and platforms used to implement them, and of the methods that let companies implement appropriate solutions for their needs.

Topics covered include: data modelling, business process modelling, cloud architectures, and Internet of Things.
