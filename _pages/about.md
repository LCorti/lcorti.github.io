**Ciao :)**

I am a PhD Candidate in the [Web Information Systems (WIS)](https://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/) group at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/). There, I am supervised by Dr. [Jie Yang](https://yangjiera.github.io/) and Prof.Dr.Ir. [Geert-Jan Houben](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7SLMWEcAAAAJ&hl=en).
I am part of the Kappa team (within WIS) and the TU Delft AI Lab [Design@Scale](https://www.tudelft.nl/ai/design-at-scale-lab).
There, I work on human-centred approaches to Explainable AI, with a particular focus on diagnosing Large Multi-modal and Language Models. By drawing connections between Computer Science, Human-Computer Interaction, and Design, I aim to create computational methods and tools that support developers' diagnostic efforts and that are grounded in understanding their uses and purposes.

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a Research Assistant at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/) where I contributed to two EU H2020 projects, [TRIGGER](https://trigger-project.eu/) and [PERISCOPE](https://periscopeproject.eu/).
I received my MSc (supervised by [Marco Brambilla](https://marco-brambilla.com/)) and BSc in Computer Science and Engineering from [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/) in 2019 and 2017 respectively.
